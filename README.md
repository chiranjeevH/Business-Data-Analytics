# Business Data Analytics in Telecommunications Using Power BI

### Project Summary

This project presents a sophisticated solution developed with Python for deep analysis of Call Detail Records (CDRs) within the telecommunications sector, enriched with the visualization power of Power BI dashboards. CDRs, which chronicle extensive details like call duration, timestamps, and contact numbers, are pivotal for understanding communication flows. By harnessing Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization, this initiative enables profound insights into calling trends, behaviors, and irregularities, supporting strategic business decisions in telecommunications.

### Key Features

- **CDR Data Extraction**: Utilizes Python to parse and extract vital information from CDRs across multiple formats including CSV, JSON, and Excel.
- **Data Preparation**: Engages in thorough data cleansing, filtering, and transformation to lay the foundation for reliable analytical outcomes.
- **Analytical Insights**: Delivers comprehensive call analytics covering aspects like call volumes over various timeframes, average call lengths, frequent callers, and primary call recipients.
- **Targeted Investigation**: Offers functionality to delve into specific client or number-based analyses, aiding in nuanced understanding of call dynamics.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Generates dynamic Power BI dashboards, presenting complex data through intuitive charts, graphs, and interactive interfaces.
- **Ease of Use**: Features a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI), guiding users seamlessly through the analytical journey and dashboard creation.

### Implementation Guide

To leverage this solution for business data analysis in telecommunications, follow the instructions below:

1. Secure the project by cloning it from `git clone https://github.com/chiranjeevH/CDR-Analysis.git`.
2. Install necessary Python packages with pip install libraries like `pandas` , ` collections`.
3. Organize your CDR data files appropriately within the project directory for analysis.
4. Initiate the analysis process with `python cdr_analysis.py` in the command line, adhering to the prompts for a guided experience.
5. Upon completion, access the generated Power BI dashboard file with Power BI Desktop for in-depth analysis and visualization.
