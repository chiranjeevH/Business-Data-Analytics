# Call Detail Records Analysis with Power BI Dashboard

![Project Banner](https://example.com/path/to/project/banner.png)

## Project Overview

This GitHub project provides a comprehensive Python-based solution for analyzing Call Detail Records (CDRs) and presenting the insights through interactive Power BI dashboards. Call Detail Records are telecommunication data logs that contain valuable information about calls, including call duration, timestamps, caller and receiver numbers, and more. Leveraging Python's data processing capabilities and Power BI's visualization features, this project empowers users to explore and understand call patterns, trends, and anomalies in their communication network.

## Features

1. **CDR Data Parsing**: The Python program reads and parses CDR data files in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, or Excel, to extract relevant call information.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The program performs necessary data cleaning, filtering, and transformation operations to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

3. **Call Analytics**: The program offers an array of analytics options, including call volume per hour/day/week/month, average call duration, most frequent callers, top call receivers, and more.

4. **Search and Analyze**: Users can search for specific clients or phone numbers to conduct targeted analysis on their call behavior and patterns.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**: The program generates dynamic Power BI dashboards that visualize the call insights with charts, graphs, and interactive elements.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**: The project provides an intuitive command-line interface (CLI) to guide users through the analysis process and dashboard generation.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CDR-Analysis.git`.

2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Prepare your CDR data files and ensure they are placed in the appropriate directory.

4. Execute the Python program by running `python cdr_analysis.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

5. After the analysis is complete, the Power BI dashboard file will be generated and can be opened using Power BI Desktop.
