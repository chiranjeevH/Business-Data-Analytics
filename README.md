# Data Analytics Using Power BI

## Project Summary
This initiative significantly transformed stakeholder engagement within the telecommunications industry by leveraging the capabilities of Power BI in conjunction with Python for comprehensive business analysis. By focusing on real-time monitoring and analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), we've dramatically improved internal business partner collaboration and customer retention strategies. Through the meticulous analysis of Call Detail Records (CDRs), this project enabled a data-driven approach to understand customer behaviors and network usage patterns, thereby reducing annual customer churn by 1,200 and halving the analysis time from 20 to 10 hours.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Stakeholder Engagement:** Developed strategies using Power BI dashboards to engage stakeholders, showcasing real-time KPIs and driving data-centric discussions.
- **CDR Data Extraction:** Employed Python to systematically parse and extract critical data from CDRs in formats like CSV, JSON, and Excel, underpinning the analysis with robust data foundations.
- **Data Preparation & Analysis:** Engaged in extensive data cleansing, transformation, and filtering processes, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the insights derived from call analytics.
- **Insights into Customer Behavior:** Provided analytical insights into call volumes, durations, and patterns, identifying frequent callers and main call recipients to support targeted customer retention strategies.
- **Interactive Dashboards for Real-time Monitoring:** Utilized Power BI to create dynamic dashboards, facilitating an intuitive understanding of complex datasets through visual representations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed a command-line interface (CLI) for streamlined analysis and dashboard generation, enhancing ease of use and accessibility for business users.

## Implementation Guide
To adopt this advanced analytical solution and replicate its success in enhancing stakeholder engagement and reducing customer churn, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository via `git clone https://github.com/chiranjeevH/CDR-Analysis.git`.
2. Install the required Python packages including `pandas` and `collections` using `pip install`.
3. Organize your CDR files within the project directory to prepare for analysis.
4. Begin the analysis by executing `python cdr_analysis.py` in the terminal, following the prompts for a guided analysis process.
5. After analysis, access the Power BI dashboard file with Power BI Desktop for detailed visualization and stakeholder engagement.
